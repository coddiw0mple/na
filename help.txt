Sodium: A modern editor for the Redox OS
========================================
by Ticki et al.

Sodium is a editor inspired by a various
console based, keyboard-centric editor.
The keybindings are loosly based on Vim.

This is a small guide for using Sodium.

Sodium consists of three different types
of command sets.

1) Global commands. These are possible to
   use anywhere, in any mode.
2) Mode-specific commands. These are
   specific to a given mode.
3) Namespaces. Commands that can be
   invoked as input (after) certain
   commands.

The modes are of two types:
- Command mode: In command mode a command
  can be preceeded by a numeral. This
  numeral is called a parameter, and can
  mean various things for the command.
- Primitive mode: In this type of mode
  the keys are given directly to the
  handler without any form of parsing.

Global commands
---------------

- [alt][space]: Go to the next cursor.
- [alt]<motion>: Move a given motion.
- [shift][space]: Go back to normal mode.

Modes
-----

# Normal

This is the default mode. Normal mode
provides various commands. Normal mode
is intended for doing commands which
are often invoked and commands used to
change modes.

The following commands are valid in
normal mode:

NOTE: <numeral> means repeat command
      <numeral> times, unless otherwise
      stated.

Basic motion:
- <numeral>h : Go left
- <numeral>j : Go down
- <numeral>k : Go up
- <numeral>l : Go right
- <numeral>J : Go 15 down
- <numeral>K : Go 15 up
- <numeral>H : Go to the start of
               the line
- <numeral>L : Go to the end of the
               line

Navigation:
- <numeral>g : Go to <numeral> line
- g<motion> : Do <motion>
- G : Go to the end of the document
- <numeral>t<char> : Go to the next occurence
                     of <char>
- <numeral>f<char> : Go to the previous occurence
                     of <char>

Scrolling:
- z<motion> : Scroll <motion>
- <numeral>z : Scroll to line <numeral>
- Z : Scroll to cursor

Cursor management:
- b : Branch the cursor
- B : Delete the current cursor
- [space] : Go to the next cursor

Editing:
- i : Go to insert mode
- a : Go to insert (append) mode
- r<char> : Replace the current char
            with <char>
- R : Go to replace mode
- x : Delete char
- X : Backspace char
- d<motion> : Delete a given selection
              (given by <motion>)
- o : Insert a new line
- ~ : Switch the character under the cursor
      with its counterpart (if it has one).
      For example a -> A
                  ( -> )
                  / -> \
- ; : Go to prompt mode
- . : Repeat the previous command


# Insert

Insert text before the cursor.

# Replace

Replace the text under the cursor.

# Prompt

Prompt mode is a mode where you can
invoke commands like in Vi(m). In this
mode you can for example set/unset options.

Following commands are valid:

- set <option> : Set <option>
- unset <option> : Unset <option>
- toggle <option> : Toggle <option>
- get <option> : Get the state of <option>
- o <filename> : Open <filename> in a new buffer
- help : Open this guide.
- w <filename> : Write the buffer to <filename>
- ls : List the available buffers
- b<numeral> : Switch to buffer <numeral>
- bd : Delete the current buffer
- q : Quit Sodium.

Following option exists:

- highlight or hl : Highlight the text
                    (useful for coding)
  default: on
- autoindent or ai : Automatically indent
                     newlines.
  default: on
- line_marker or lm : Slightly dim the
                      background of the
                      current line
  default: on

To leave prompt press enter and the command
will be invoked. To leave the prompt without
invoking the command use the usual
shift-space command.

Namespaces
----------

A namespace is a set of commands which is
not dependent to any mode.

# <motion>

<numeral> means repeat unless otherwise
stated.

- <numeral>h : Go left
- <numeral>j : Go down
- <numeral>k : Go up
- <numeral>l : Go right
- <numeral>J : Go 15 down
- <numeral>K : Go 15 up
- <numeral>H : Go to the start of
               the line
- <numeral>L : Go to the end of the
               line
- <numeral>g : Go to <numeral> line
- G : Go to the end of the document
- <numeral>t<char> : Go to the next occurence
                     of <char>
- <numeral>f<char> : Go to the previous occurence
                     of <char>
